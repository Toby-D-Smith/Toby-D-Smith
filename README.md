### Hi there, I'm Toby

I'm a software developer from Coventry

During my Mathematics degree from the University of Warwick, I discovered a passion for creative and practical problem solving. Finding programming was a great place to exercise this problem solving, I picked up Javascript and joined the School of Code! (A 6 month part bootcamp focused on front end development)
Learning many things, particularly inspired by different algorithms and logic. Having been working in the tech world for the last few years I've found a great joy in both API's and Databases.
