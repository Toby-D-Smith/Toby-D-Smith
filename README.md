### Hi there, I'm Toby

I'm a software developer from Coventry specialised in JavaScript

During my Mathematics degree from the University of Warwick, I discovered a passion for creative and practical problem solving. Finding programming was a great place to exercise this problem solving, I picked up Javascript and joined the School of Code! (A 6 month part bootcamp focused on front end development)
Learning many things, particularly inspired by different algorithms and logic. An example of this is my Sudoku App.

I'm excited to see what else the Tech world can offer and I can impact the future of technology!
